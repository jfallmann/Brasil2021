During the first funding phase we were able to complete reseach on
tree-like networks, resulting in a an efficient algorithm for estimating
eigenvalue counts for this type of networks. This resulted in joint
publication in J. Complex Networks. In addition to the DAAD-funded short
travel, two PhD students from the Fujita lab in Sao Paulo are currently
spending extentended reseach stays in the Stadler lab in Leipzig. Bruno
Ilha is working on metabolic networks, and Grover Guzman just arrived in
Leipzig. He will continue the joint work on eigenvalues in simple network
classes. The DAAD exchange has been very helpful in securing external
funding. As planned, a network meeting in Sao Paulo has taken place in 2002
with participation of 4 researchers from Leipzig including the PI, and
Andre Fujita and collaborator have visited Leipzig in 2022 and in spring
2023. The second scheduled visit of the Leipzig group to Sao Paulo in the
current funding period is scheduled for Nov/Dec. Software development is
ongoing. Current focus of the work is on improvements of the theoretical
results. Early stage researches, notably Nora Beier, have been closely
involved in preparing the annual report for 2022 and this renewal
application.
