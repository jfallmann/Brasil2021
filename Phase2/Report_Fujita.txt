Workshop on Network Statistics
The workshop occurred between September 15th and 16th at Prof. Imre Simon Auditorium at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo. Approximately 30 people attended this workshop, including (under) graduate students and faculty members from the University of São Paulo, Federal University of ABC, Federal University of Technology - Paraná, Sírio Libanês Hospital, Leipzig University, and the Hamburg University of Technology. We had two main talks - one by Prof. Peter Stadler (German coordinator) and one by Prof. André Fujita (Brazilian coordinator), seven oral presentations, and two group meetings (one each day) to allow participants to build new collaborations.
